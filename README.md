# rob-moore1894.github.io
This is my resume page.  It is built simply utilizing a template from HTML5 Up and is hosted through GitHub.  It was previously hosted through Google but due to budget constraints, I took it down.  

As of 10/10/2022, I have only made minimal changes.  Adding updates to work status as needed. 

I will not publish Oracle products that I built for customers on to this site for security and proprietary reasons.
